# movie_db_project

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a sample of how I work with Flutter.
For this example I'm using:

GetX for state manager.

https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api?language=pt-BR for the API.

Dio for http request (RESTfull).

Using clean architecture for the project trying to include all the principles of SOLID.


OBS: the current project still ongoing and has no date to be finished
